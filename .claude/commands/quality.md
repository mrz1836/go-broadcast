# ðŸŽ¯ Comprehensive Code Quality Enforcement

I need to ensure the codebase meets all quality standards using our extensive linting suite.

**Primary: Use the go-quality-enforcer agent** to:

1. **Run all 60+ configured linters**:
   - golangci-lint with custom configuration
   - gofumpt for consistent formatting
   - Security linters (gosec, etc.)
   - Performance linters
   - Style and convention checkers

2. **Automatically fix issues**:
   - Apply gofumpt formatting
   - Fix simple linting violations
   - Update deprecated code patterns
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions

3. **Handle complex issues**:
   - Refactor code to eliminate linting errors
   - Add necessary comments for exported functions
   - Fix cyclomatic complexity issues
   - Resolve duplicate code warnings

**In parallel: Use the test-commander agent** to:
- Verify tests still pass after quality fixes
- Ensure no regressions from auto-fixes

## Quality Check Scope: $ARGUMENTS

The agents will work together to achieve 100% linting compliance while maintaining all functionality. Any issues that cannot be auto-fixed will be clearly documented with recommended solutions.
