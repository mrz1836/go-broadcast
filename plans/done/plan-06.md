# Pre-Release Documentation Review Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to perform a final pre-release review of all supporting documentation and messaging across the go-broadcast project. The goal is to ensure consistency, accuracy, and proper first-time launch positioning throughout all communication materials.

## Objectives

1. **Consistency and Accuracy**: Ensure all documentation reflects the true current state of the software
2. **First-Time Launch Positioning**: Remove any implications that this is an update to existing software
3. **Present Tense Language**: Eliminate aspirational or speculative content
4. **Developer Experience**: Optimize all materials for a developer-first experience
5. **Quality Assurance**: Remove marketing fluff, TODOs, and incomplete explanations

## Technical Approach

### Review Methodology
- Systematic file-by-file analysis of all supporting materials
- Cross-reference consistency checks between related documents
- Validation of all runnable examples and code snippets
- Present tense language enforcement across all content
- First-time launch messaging alignment
- Compliance verification with `.github/AGENTS.md` conventions and standards
- Alignment with existing technical documentation framework

### Quality Standards
- All verbiage in present tense (✅ "returns", ❌ "will return")
- No references to "new features", "updates", or "enhancements"  
- All examples must be accurate and runnable
- Consistent tone and formatting throughout
- Remove all TODOs, placeholders, and speculative content
- Adhere to conventions established in `.github/AGENTS.md` for all technical content
- Follow markdown standards defined in AGENTS.md for document structure and formatting

### NOTE: AFTER EVERY PHASE
- run: `make lint` to ensure code quality
- run: `make test` to ensure all tests pass
- validate all examples are runnable

## Implementation Phases
