# Plan-07 Status: Code Duplication Reduction

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup and Mock Consolidation ✓
- Created `internal/testutil/mock.go` with shared mock utilities
- Created `internal/testutil/files.go` with test file helpers
- Refactored mock files to use shared utilities
- All tests passing with race detection

### Phase 2: Test Helper Consolidation ✓
- Extended `internal/benchmark/helpers.go` with file creation utilities
- Refactored benchmark tests to use shared helpers
- Replaced 50+ file creation patterns with centralized utilities
- All benchmark tests passing with consistent performance

### Phase 3: Error Handling and Validation Standardization ✓
- Extended `internal/errors/errors.go` with context and validation utilities
- Created `internal/validation/validation.go` with shared validation logic
- Refactored 50+ error creation patterns to use standardized utilities
- Consolidated validation logic from multiple packages

### Phase 4: JSON Processing and Benchmark Optimization ✓
- Created `internal/jsonutil` package with type-safe JSON utilities
  - MarshalJSON/UnmarshalJSON with generics
  - GenerateTestJSON for benchmark data
  - PrettyPrint and CompactJSON utilities
  - MergeJSON for combining objects
- Refactored JSON processing in:
  - internal/logging/formatter.go
  - internal/gh/github.go
  - internal/benchmark/reporter.go
- Optimized benchmark test patterns:
  - Replaced manual b.ResetTimer() with benchmark.WithMemoryTracking()
  - Updated git/concurrent_benchmark_test.go to use shared utilities
- Created comprehensive documentation (README.md)
- All tests passing with full lint compliance

## Summary

Phase 4 has been successfully completed. The jsonutil package provides:
- Type-safe JSON operations with consistent error handling
- Reduced code duplication across JSON processing
- Improved benchmark test patterns
- Better maintainability through centralized utilities

All deliverables have been achieved:
- ✓ New `internal/jsonutil` package with 6 core utilities
- ✓ Reduced JSON-related code duplication
- ✓ Optimized benchmark test patterns with consistent structure
- ✓ Maintained or improved performance in JSON operations
- ✓ All tests passing with no regressions
- ✓ Full lint compliance maintained

## Next Steps

Phase 5: Final Cleanup and Validation can now begin, focusing on:
- String building optimization
- Test pattern standardization
- Final integration validation
- Documentation updates
