## Key Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- Configuration via .env.shared (like coverage system)
- MVP with just 5 essential hooks
- Use make commands to match fortress workflows
- No YAML configuration files
- Simple 3-command CLI

### Design Choices
- Environment-driven configuration
- Direct make command execution
- Built-in implementations for text fixes
- Parallel execution by default
- Clear error messages

### Trade-offs
- No hook-specific config in MVP (use env vars)
- Limited to pre-commit hook initially
- No caching in MVP (add later if needed)

## Implementation Notes

### MVP Design Decisions
- Pure Go implementation
- Separate module in .github/pre-commit/
- Configuration via .env.shared
- Integration with fortress make commands
- Start with 5 essential pre-commit hooks only

### MVP Features
- Parallel execution
- Environment-based configuration
- CI/CD integration
- Make command consistency
- Simple install/uninstall

### Changes from Original Plan
- Simplified to MVP with 5 pre-commit hooks only
- Configuration via .env.shared (no YAML)
- Just 3 CLI commands (install, run, uninstall)
- No caching or progress bars in MVP
- Following coverage system pattern

### User Feedback
- TBD

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Phase)
1. ✅ Phase 1 complete - Foundation & Configuration implemented
2. ✅ Phase 2 complete - Core Pre-commit Engine implemented
3. ✅ Phase 3 complete - All MVP pre-commit checks implemented
4. Next: Phase 4 - Git Integration & Installation (partially complete)

### Upcoming
1. Build core pre-commit engine with env config
2. Implement 5 MVP pre-commit hooks
3. Test with team before expanding

### Post-MVP
1. Gather team feedback
2. Add most requested pre-commit hooks
3. Consider caching for expensive operations
4. Expand to other git hooks (pre-push, commit-msg)
