## Metrics

### Planning Phase Metrics
- **Documentation**: 2250+ lines of comprehensive planning
- **Configuration Options**: 39 environment variables defined (30 coverage + 9 logging/debug)
- **Exclusion Options**: 7 types of file/folder exclusions
- **Architecture Components**: 5 core Go packages designed
- **Test Coverage Target**: 100% for Go packages
- **UI/UX Features**: 15+ modern interface enhancements with server-side rendering
- **Logging Features**: 5 structured logging capabilities added
- **Debug Features**: 4 debugging and monitoring options included

### Expected Implementation Metrics
- **Coverage Processing**: <2s badge generation
- **Report Generation**: <10s for large projects
- **PR Comments**: <5s response time
- **Storage Efficiency**: Automatic cleanup after 7-90 days
- **Availability**: 99.9% via GitHub Pages

## Risk Log

### Identified Risks
1. **GitHub Pages Limits**: 1GB storage limit
   - Mitigation: Implement automatic cleanup and compression
   
2. **Large Repository Performance**: Processing time for huge codebases
   - Mitigation: Incremental processing and caching
   
3. **Concurrent Updates**: Race conditions in gh-pages commits
   - Mitigation: Implement locking mechanism

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1 implementation:
   - Add environment variables to `.env.shared`
   - Create directory structure
   - Remove Codecov dependencies

2. Build Go coverage tool binary

3. Create test repositories for validation
