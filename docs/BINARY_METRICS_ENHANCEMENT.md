# Binary File Metrics Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the internal/sync/directory.go and related files to add comprehensive binary file metrics tracking to provide better visibility into file processing operations.

## Changes Made

### 1. DirectoryMetrics Struct Enhancement (`directory_progress.go`)
Added new fields to track binary file processing:
```go
// Binary file metrics
BinaryFilesSkipped        int
BinaryFilesSize           int64
TransformErrors           int
TransformSuccesses        int
TotalTransformDuration    time.Duration
TransformCount            int // Track number of transforms for averaging
```

### 2. DirectoryProgressReporter Methods (`directory_progress.go`)
Added new methods to record binary file metrics:
- `RecordBinaryFileSkipped(size int64)` - Records a binary file that was skipped with its size
- `RecordTransformError()` - Records a transformation error
- `RecordTransformSuccess(duration time.Duration)` - Records a successful transformation with its duration
- `GetAverageTransformDuration() time.Duration` - Calculates average transform duration

### 3. Enhanced Progress Reporting Interface (`batch.go`)
Created new interface extending the basic ProgressReporter:
```go
type EnhancedProgressReporter interface {
    ProgressReporter
    RecordBinaryFileSkipped(size int64)
    RecordTransformError()
    RecordTransformSuccess(duration time.Duration)
}
```

### 4. BatchProgressWrapper Enhancement (`directory_progress.go`)
Updated BatchProgressWrapper to implement EnhancedProgressReporter interface, enabling binary file metrics reporting from batch processing operations.

### 5. Batch Processor Integration (`batch.go`)
- Created `processFileJobWithReporter()` method that accepts an EnhancedProgressReporter
- Updated binary file detection to report metrics when binary files are encountered
- Enhanced transformation error/success handling to report metrics
- Modified `workerWithProgress()` to use enhanced reporting when available

### 6. Directory Processing Integration (`directory.go`)
- Updated logging in `ProcessDirectoryMapping()` to include new binary file metrics
- Enhanced final summary to display:
  - Binary files skipped count
  - Total binary files size
  - Transform errors and successes
  - Average transform duration

### 7. Enhanced Logging Output
The completion logging now includes comprehensive metrics:
```
"binary_files_skipped": 3,
"binary_files_size_bytes": 2048,
"transform_errors": 1,
"transform_successes": 5,
"avg_transform_duration_ms": 150,
```

## Key Features

### Binary File Detection
- Automatically detects binary files using the existing `transform.IsBinary()` function
- Records both count and total size of binary files
- Reports metrics immediately when binary files are encountered

### Transform Performance Tracking
- Tracks individual transformation durations
- Calculates average transformation time
- Counts both successful and failed transformations
- Provides detailed performance insights

### Backward Compatibility
- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing code continues to work without modification
- Enhanced features are optional and activate when appropriate interfaces are used

### Thread Safety
- All metrics operations are thread-safe using mutex protection
- Concurrent file processing safely updates shared metrics
- No race conditions in metrics collection

## Testing
Comprehensive test suite added (`binary_metrics_test.go`) covering:
- Basic binary file metrics tracking
- Enhanced progress reporter interface compliance
- Integration with directory processing workflow
- Metrics accuracy and calculation correctness

## Usage
The enhanced metrics are automatically collected when processing directories and are included in the final processing summary logs. No configuration changes are required - the enhancement is transparent to existing users while providing valuable additional insights.

## Benefits
1. **Better Visibility**: Clear insight into binary vs text file processing
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track transformation performance and identify bottlenecks
3. **Error Tracking**: Monitor transformation failure rates
4. **Capacity Planning**: Understand file type distribution and processing characteristics
5. **Debugging**: Enhanced logging helps identify processing issues
