## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. **Start Simple**
Begin with basic commands like `/test` and `/quality` before using complex workflows

### 2. **Use in CI/CD**
Commands like `/audit` and `/test` are designed for automation in CI/CD pipelines.

### 3. **Combine Commands**
Use commands sequentially for complete workflows by running them one after another.

### 4. **Leverage Arguments**
Be specific when needed:
```bash
/refactor @internal/complex-module.go
/debug "specific error message"
```

### 5. **Monitor Agent Output**
Watch for agent recommendations and warnings in the output

### 6. **Regular Maintenance**
Use these commands regularly:
- `/deps` - Weekly dependency review
- `/debt analyze` - Monthly tech debt review
- `/security` - Before each release

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found
```bash
# List all available commands
/help

# Ensure commands directory exists
ls .claude/commands/
```

### Agent Errors
- Check agent output for specific error messages
- Verify required tools are available
- Ensure proper GitHub authentication

### Performance Issues
- Use `/profile` to identify bottlenecks
- Run `/workflow` to optimize CI/CD
- Consider using specific targets instead of full scans

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Parallel Execution
Many commands use parallel agents for speed:
- `/security` runs 3 security agents simultaneously
- `/pr-fix` coordinates 3 fix agents in parallel
- `/deps` analyzes updates with 3 specialized agents

### Sequential Workflows
Some commands use sequential processing:
- `/release` ensures each step completes before the next
- `/debug` gathers diagnostics before deep analysis
- `/dedupe` finds duplicates before refactoring

### Smart Context
Commands understand context:
- File references with `@filename`
- Issue/PR numbers
- Version tags
- Error messages

## üìà Command Performance

| Command | Typical Duration | Agents | Parallel |
|---------|-----------------|---------|----------|
| `/test` | 30-60s | 2 | ‚úÖ |
| `/security` | 45-90s | 3 | ‚úÖ |
| `/release` | 2-5min | 5 | ‚ùå |
| `/pr-fix` | 60-120s | 3 | ‚úÖ |
